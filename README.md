# 🕹️ Hangman

This project is one of the tasks in the UK Department of Education funded Frontend Developer course I am taking part in. 

The task was to create a "Hangman" game in React. Purpose of game is to reveal a word before all parts of drawing are shown.

## 📑 Rules of the game
              
- Guess the word by selecting letters on keyboard.
- Each wrong guess will add a body part to the hangman.
- Guess the word before the hangman is complete
- You can restart anytime by clicking Reset button
